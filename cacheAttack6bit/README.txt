The code in this section is just a naive implementation of a Flush+Reload attack. 
For the reasons presented in the report it was tested on a single L1 cache of an ARM Cortex-a53 and it can read up to 6-bit at a time.
This result was not significant enough for our purposes so this version of the attack was not embedded in the final code of Spectre.
